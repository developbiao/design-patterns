0:20
that's cute well listen up bob you're
0:22
gonna have to forget about those index
0:24
funds and blue chip companies i mean
0:25
come on
0:26
single digit returns what is this the
0:29
little leagues you should be aiming for
0:30
one percent a day
0:32
minimum no no no i know what you're
0:34
thinking hasn't
0:35
warren buffett the best investor in the
0:37
world only made like
0:38
20 a year well you know what i tripled
0:40
my total net worth of at least a few
0:42
hundred dollars last month alone
0:45
so really who are you gonna listen to
0:47
old man value
0:48
or this chad who's making a killing
0:50
yellowing it
0:52
what's that that how long have i been
0:54
investing
0:55
like six months why
1:04
if you're new to investing the recent
1:06
performance of a few key positions may
1:08
have convinced you that
1:09
investing is a easy source of riches
1:12
not only are there stories of
1:14
individuals making an absolute killing
1:15
in the market with
1:16
over 1 000 returns but some people like
1:20
to suggest
1:21
that high returns are easy from traders
1:23
peddling the popular one percent a day
1:25
target
1:26
to random people who have only been
1:28
investing for a short while
1:29
highlighting that high returns are
1:31
reasonable for the beginner
1:33
but the truth is the return that most of
1:35
us will likely experience
1:37
throughout our entire investing journey
1:40
is
1:40
much lower than what others may claim to
1:42
achieve on the one hand people often
1:44
exaggerate their own experience and
1:46
provide only short-term snippets of
1:48
their results
1:49
and on the other hand the past decade
1:52
has been
1:52
exceptionally kind to stocks and there
1:55
are a few reasons the recent returns of
1:57
the market
1:58
may not repeat into the future as we'll
2:00
discuss in the second half of this video
2:03
so we shouldn't allow ourselves to
2:04
become distracted by stories of people
2:07
doubling or tripling their money in the
2:09
past month
2:10
after all it can be harmful for us to
2:12
anticipate remarkable performance
2:14
it often works against us and when
2:15
things do fall short
2:17
you're more motivated to change
2:19
strategies or pursue higher risk
2:21
things that will likely work against you
2:23
so today we're going to go after a
2:25
sobering journey towards a more
2:26
reasonable target if you will it's not
2:28
going to be fun but
2:29
i think it's important and we'll start
2:31
by addressing the more exuberant
2:33
expectations i've seen online
2:35
take the one percent a day for example
2:37
something almost
2:38
every training course seems to tout at
2:40
one point or another at first glance it
2:42
probably doesn't seem that
2:43
unrealistic the markets do after all
2:46
seem to rise and fall by roughly
2:48
one percent a day so how hard can it
2:50
really be to be on the right side of
2:52
that movement
2:53
over time but it doesn't take much to
2:55
see why this is a very unlikely goal
2:58
when you consider daily compounding or
2:59
interest on top of interest
3:01
a one percent daily return can turn a
3:02
100 investment into twelve hundred and
3:05
forty dollars after one year
3:06
over fifteen thousand dollars after two
3:08
years and over 691 billion dollars in
3:11
nine years time
3:12
congratulations you've become the
3:14
richest person in the world
3:16
not bad for a 100 investment so clearly
3:19
one percent a day
3:20
isn't that reasonable but even an annual
3:22
return in the high double digits isn't
3:24
really that likely
3:25
but richard that can't be true i just
3:27
doubled my money this past month
3:29
that's great truly but achieving a
3:32
one-off spike in returns
3:33
doesn't mean that you've found the key
3:35
to the stock market
3:36
what really matters here is consistency
3:39
and very few people are able to achieve
3:41
anything above
3:42
20 regularly over a 10 to 30 year period
3:46
consider for example the medallion fund
3:48
one of the best performing hedge funds
3:50
in the world
3:51
that's known for hiring mathematicians
3:53
scientists and physicists
3:55
to research stock opportunities this
3:57
group has allegedly been able to earn
3:59
more than 66
4:00
annually from 1988 to 2018
4:04
earning their investors 39 a year after
4:06
fees
4:07
now that's a remarkable return but if
4:10
that's the
4:11
unverified claim of one of the best
4:13
hedge funds in the world
4:15
chances are the rest of us are likely
4:17
going to fall short
4:18
so what can the average investor expect
4:20
well again in any given year your return
4:23
might be higher or lower than this
4:24
amount
4:25
but it's good to kind of gauge your
4:26
expectation at the eight percent to 12
4:29
range as a general rule of thumb this
4:32
range is grounded after all in the
4:34
90-year average return of the s p 500
4:37
which stands at 9.8 percent
4:39
and while this is of course not a
4:40
perfect measure given the makeup of the
4:42
index
4:43
and the fact that past returns don't
4:44
guarantee future returns
4:46
it's one of the best gauges we have now
4:48
of course if you aren't 100 invested in
4:50
stocks then your return will deviate
4:52
further from this amount
4:54
those with money in riskier assets like
4:56
alternatives may see higher returns
4:58
and those in safer assets like bonds
5:00
will likely see lower returns
5:02
but even with alternatives and other
5:04
opportunities your
5:05
long-term return is not likely to
5:07
deviate meaningfully from this range
5:09
but there are positions that have done
5:11
better than that surely we can
5:13
outperform the market if we invest in
5:14
those
5:15
right well yes there are certain
5:17
positions that have seen higher returns
5:19
than this over the long term
5:21
and it's not impossible to beat the
5:23
market in the same way some people
5:25
do win the lottery some investors do
5:27
make it big with certain bets and
5:29
positions
5:29
but again the idea is we're trying to
5:31
set our gauge or our expectation
5:33
of what returns we'll see we don't want
5:35
to put that too high or else we'll
5:36
likely be disappointed
5:38
and fall victim to certain biases so we
5:40
only care about the long-term consistent
5:42
returns
5:43
that investors are likely to achieve
5:45
consider for example the mid-year 2020
5:48
us biba scorecard which showed that over
5:50
a 15-year period
5:52
86.9 of large cap managers 81.4 percent
5:55
of mid cap managers
5:56
and 81.5 percent of small cap managers
5:59
fail to outperform the
6:00
s p 500 you see even though certain
6:03
stocks and
6:03
certain sectors outperform from time to
6:05
time their returns don't often stay that
6:08
way
6:08
and it's been proven very difficult to
6:10
time your investments
6:12
to only take advantage of their upswing
6:14
cycles so
6:15
yes there are some that do achieve
6:17
stronger results than the index
6:19
but the point is we shouldn't go into it
6:22
expecting that we'll outperform
6:24
given how little data actually supports
6:26
that notion
6:28
now this isn't a question the merit of
6:30
investors who have done well
6:32
especially recently but oftentimes the
6:35
people boasting about high returns
6:37
tend to have short track records that
6:39
are no longer than just a few years
6:41
and it really doesn't make sense to
6:42
treat such a short track record
6:44
as being representative of our own
6:47
long-term prospects
6:48
most of us have yet to experience a
6:50
multi-year decline
6:51
so strategies that are higher risk and
6:54
have done well this past decade
6:56
for example trading call options and
6:58
taking on leverage
7:00
are unlikely to bode well should we
7:02
encounter a longer downturn
7:04
furthermore hindsight is 20 20 and we
7:07
shouldn't cherry-pick the returns of a
7:08
few
7:09
individual positions or individuals to
7:12
forecast our own future performance
7:14
time and time again we've seen that high
7:16
performing funds and managers
7:18
of the industry eventually tend to fall
7:21
short as time passes
7:23
but richard this time is different let
7:25
me stop you there
7:26
i know more people than before seem to
7:28
be excited about stocks these days
7:30
especially with certain technological
7:32
advances that have made trading easier
7:34
for the average joe
7:35
and hey the s p has earned a higher than
7:37
average 15
7:38
annually over this past five years so
7:41
some may come to think that returns are
7:43
gaining speed and will
7:44
accelerate into the future but the truth
7:47
is
7:47
the recent stock market performance has
7:49
been driven by a few key factors
7:51
three to be exact and these factors in
7:54
all likelihood are
7:55
not going to be sticking around forever
7:57
firstly ever since the 2008 financial
7:59
crisis
8:00
the stock market has benefited from rock
8:02
bottom interest rates
8:03
as you know interest rates are the rate
8:05
charged to anyone borrowing money
8:07
and when rates are low companies are
8:09
able to borrow money for
8:10
well less money something that
8:12
inherently makes them more profitable
8:14
central banks around the world have been
8:16
pushing down interest rates to support
8:18
their economies
8:19
something that has provided many
8:20
companies access to financing to expand
8:22
operations
8:23
but eventually these rates should be
8:26
increased
8:27
as things improve that means higher
8:29
expenses
8:30
and lower access to capital for public
8:32
companies things that could very well
8:34
hurt their stocks performance and
8:37
therefore impact our own portfolios
8:39
secondly in addition to low interest
8:41
rates we've seen unprecedented
8:43
quantitative easing in the us
8:45
i'll leave a link to another video of
8:47
mine in the description below
8:48
explaining how qe works but this is
8:51
essentially
8:52
another stock market stimulant the move
8:54
increases money supply and tends to
8:56
boost
8:57
inflows into the stock market so if it
9:00
is eventually reversed as
9:01
and it should be in theory that will
9:03
mean less money in the stock market and
9:05
again
9:06
an impact on returns finally while
9:08
stocks have certainly been chugging
9:10
along the past decade
9:11
the underlying companies haven't
9:13
actually been keeping up
9:15
what i mean by that well since 2010
9:18
stock prices have been rising faster
9:20
than the profits of the underlying firms
9:22
meaning people have essentially been
9:24
paying higher amounts or
9:25
paying higher valuations for the same
9:28
fundamental companies
9:29
a simple measure of this is shiller's p
9:31
e ratio
9:32
a cyclically adjusted ratio of a
9:34
company's stock price to their
9:36
underlying profits
9:37
stock price divided by earnings per
9:38
share and over the last 10 years the
9:41
measure has increased
9:42
meaningfully from 23 times at the end of
9:44
2010
9:45
to 34.9 times at the end of 2020. to put
9:48
that into perspective while the stock
9:50
market has risen by roughly 200 percent
9:52
over the past decade
9:53
or 11.6 a year earnings have only
9:56
increased
9:57
just above 100 or 7.3 percent a year
10:01
now that could be interpreted any number
10:03
of ways investors may be expecting very
10:05
high future profits
10:06
and new technologies may have indeed
10:08
gotten people excited about different
10:10
areas of the markets but consider that
10:12
in the height of the dot-com bubble the
10:14
ratio maxed out at 44.2 times
10:18
before crashing down and that was when
10:20
people were excited about the internet
10:21
possibly one of the biggest
10:22
technological advances we've made as a
10:24
species
10:25
and something that most people believed
10:27
would revolutionize everything we know
10:29
it did of course but this didn't
10:32
translate into profits for most
10:33
underlying companies
10:35
and well you know the rest so does that
10:38
mean that stock returns are about to
10:39
crash
10:39
well no not necessarily it's impossible
10:43
to predict whether markets will go from
10:44
here i
10:45
mean that when i say it but as mentioned
10:47
these three factors have contributed
10:49
meaningfully to recent growth in the
10:50
market
10:51
so what that means is it makes more
10:53
sense for us to anchor our own
10:54
expectations to the s p 500's
10:57
long-term performance rather than what
10:59
it's done more recently given these
11:00
tailwinds
11:01
after all while things like quantitative
11:03
easing cryptocurrency
11:05
and other trends may have led some to
11:07
believe that things have
11:08
shifted fundamentally for the everyday
11:10
investor this time is different
11:12
has come to be known as one of the most
11:14
dangerous phrases in the world of
11:15
investing
11:16
we have and will continue to experience
11:19
events that we've
11:20
never encountered before and while that
11:22
doesn't mean that we should be ignorant
11:23
and certainly it's important to pay
11:25
attention to these things
11:27
the market has made it through periods
11:28
of high inflation the great depression
11:31
and booms on the opposite side of that
11:34
it stands to reason that it will likely
11:35
continue to chug along
11:37
in the long term at some sort of rate
11:39
we've seen in the past
11:41
so if you've just started investing be
11:43
disciplined
11:44
look for opportunity but try to keep
11:46
your head out of the clouds
11:47
unless of course you're a child like me
11:50
which case
11:51
i'll see you on the moon
11:56
as mentioned there's really no way to
11:58
know where the markets will go in the
11:59
short term
12:00
but there's a lot of value in
12:01
understanding how they got to where they
12:03
are
12:03
it can be a tough thing to keep track of
12:04
all the moving parts that have
12:06
contributed to our recent stock climb
12:08
but if you want a good summary i
12:09
recently listened to a great series
12:11
titled can the stock market really go
